## üéÆ How to Use

### Data Types Mode
Practice identifying data types in code:
- Analyze values and determine if they're integers, floats, strings, or booleans
- Get instant feedback with explanations
- Build understanding of fundamental data representations

### Programming Constructs Mode  
Master the three fundamental programming constructs:
- **Sequence:** Understanding step-by-step execution
- **Selection:** Working with if-else statements and conditions
- **Iteration:** Recognizing loops and repetition patterns

### Operators Mode
Practice different types of operators:
- **Arithmetic:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- **Comparison:** Equal to, greater than, less than operations  
- **Logical:** AND, OR, NOT operations

### Champion Mode
Advanced mixed challenges combining all concepts:
- Random questions from all categories
- Higher difficulty level
- Perfect for testing comprehensive understanding
