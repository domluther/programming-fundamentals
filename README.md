## 🎮 How to Use

### Unit Converter
Practice converting between different data units:
- Enter a value and select source/target units
- Get instant feedback with detailed conversion steps
- Advanced mode includes decimal and complex conversions

### File Size Calculator  
Calculate storage requirements for digital files:
- **Image Files:** Based on dimensions and color depth
- **Sound Files:** Based on sample rate, bit depth, and duration
- **Text Files:** Based on character count and encoding

### Capacity Calculator
Understand storage capacity relationships:
- Calculate how many files fit on a storage device
- Determine total storage needed for multiple files
- Learn the relationship between file sizes and storage capacity
